# Portfolio Generator-Node.js

## Description

The purpose of this project was to learn how to use Node.js. Leveraging Node, the user can create a portfolio page with their GitHub projects. The user answers questions in the command line (through inquirer), and then an HTML file is generated with all the data they provided. 

## Installation

To install this project, you can clone the repository by using the command prompt

$ git clone https://github.com/AllysonMcGrath/portfolio-generator.git

Detailed instructions for cloning GitHub repositories can be found [here.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository)



## Usage

As this app is run by using Node, it cannot be deployed. To use this app, clone the repository using the instructions above, and then from the command line run 'node app'.

When generated correctly, the HTML page should look like this:

![Site with user's name as title, with about me and seperate boxes with info about each project](./portgensite.JPG)


Use standard git commands within this repository.

Examples:

$ git mv index.html ../
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "commit description"
$ git push origin main
